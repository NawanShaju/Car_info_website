# Car_info_website

This website integrates a backend API and a frontend to provide seamless functionality. The backend API is developed using JavaScript and TypeScript for most files, leveraging the Express library for server setup. The frontend is built using Vite and React.js for a fast and interactive user experience.
The backend utilises a data store to manage data, saving it to an external file. Users can perform various operations such as adding, deleting, updating, and viewing data. The website is designed for car enthusiasts, allowing users to search for cars by name and apply filters based on model year, type, and make. Additionally, detailed specifications of each car are displayed, with options for users to update this information as needed.
